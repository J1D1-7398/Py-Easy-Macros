# Py-Easy-Macros
Easy to setup macros written in python. It only supports keyboard keys for now, but I will add support to clicks and press buttons. It should work fine on any system. If you have any questions or issue, feel free to set up an issue or contact me by e-mail.

## Requirements:
### Python:

Check https://github.com/J1D1-7398/Python-Installation-Tutorial for a full tutorial on how to install python.

"Tcl/Tk, turtle and IDLE" is not needed

### Pyautogui library:
Paste this in command prompt
```
pip install pyautogui
```

## How to use
Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded the repository.

When you have reached the directory in Command Prompt type
```
python main.py
```

✅ It should work fine!
